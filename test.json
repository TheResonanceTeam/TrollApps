Unfortunately, there has been no easy way for people to play these games whenever they so desired...that is, until now. GBA4iOS was made for one purpose and one purpose only: to help everyone relive their favorite games from their past. Now, every where you take your iPhone, iPad, or iPod Touch, you can bring and play your classic games with you, giving you practically endless hours of entertainment!\n\nSo that's great and all, but what features does GBA4iOS actually have? Far too many to list in one App Store description, but here are some of the biggest:\n\n\u2022 Multiplayer (iPhone 5 or newer, iPad 4 or newer). GBA4iOS allows you to link with other players nearby and play with them, allowing you to unlock or experience certain events in games that are unavailable to just one player! Plus, nothing is cooler than playing games with your friends.\n\n\u2022 Save States. Ever get frustrated when a game requires you to save only at certain points? Well be frustrated no longer, GBA4iOS fully supports Save States, allowing you to save anywhere in the game and resume right from that point later. Even better, you can protect certain save states so you never accidentally overwrite them (and as everyone knows losing game data is one of the worst things in the world).\n\n\u2022 Cheat Codes. Sometimes games are just too hard, and you need a little boost to help defeat it. GBA4iOS allows you to input and use GameShark, Action Replay, Code Breaker, and Game Genie codes as you see fit. Don't worry, we won't judge!\n\n\u2022 Fast Forward (iPhone 4s or newer, iPad 2 or newer, iPod Touch 5th Gen). Don't you wish there was a way to speed up long cutscenes in games, or to reduce the time doing boring tasks in the game? Well, now there is! GBA4iOS allows you to \"Fast Forward\" through slow parts of the game, allowing you to get back to the fun even quicker.\n\n\u2022 Customizable Controller Skins. Want to change the look of the controller to something more personal? No worries, you can download a multitude of new controller skins from within the app, or download almost countless more from the web! You'll definitely be able to find a controller skin you like.\n\n\u2022 Dropbox Sync. Have multiple devices, or worried something will happen to your games? Dropbox Sync solves both these issues! When enabled, GBA4iOS will sync your game saves, save states, and cheat codes to Dropbox, keeping any and all your devices up to date with your latest changes. Plus, this means your game data is always backed up in the cloud, so if something happens to your device, your data is safe.\n\n\u2022 MFi Controller Support. Sometimes, touchscreen buttons just aren't good enough for the level of precision needed by some games. Luckily, GBA4iOS supports MFi Controllers, allowing you to connect and use physical controllers with your games! Now you can beat that final boss without a sweat.\n\nAll this and more ensures that GBA4iOS will give you the best portable gaming experience, hands down. So what are you waiting for, download GBA4iOS now and enjoy reliving your favorite classic games immediately!", "iconURL": "https://i.imgur.com/SBrqO9g.png", "tintColor": "78209d", "screenshotURLs": ["https://i.imgur.com/L4H0yM3.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UPGYLVr.png", "https://i.imgur.com/sWpUAii.png", "https://i.imgur.com/UwnDXRc.png"], "versions": [{"version": "2.1", "date": "2020-03-24T14:30:00-07:00", "localizedDescription": "Initial AltStore release!", "downloadURL": "https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/altstore/sources/demo/GBA4iOS.ipa", "size": 7924507, "sha256": "523ede3000e89716dc6e16f04ddd1d6e66a950a9295784769dab3e65a5ecc351"}], "appID": "com.rileytestut.GBA4iOS"}, {"name": "RetroArch", "bundleIdentifier": "com.libretro.RetroArchiOS11", "developerName": "libretro", "subtitle": "Cross-platform, sophisticated frontend for emulation.", "localizedDescription": "RetroArch is a frontend for a plethora of emulators.

Previously, we mapped IDE devices to one unit per bus. This means on some machines, the limit was two devices maximum. Now, we map two units per IDE bus which should increase the limit to four devices. Existing VMs will _not_ get this change automatically in order to maintain compatibility.

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.5)\r\n* Reverted ANGLE to an older version which includes the fix detailed in v4.2.4 but also does not break the Metal backend (#5238)\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj, @mavethee)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the pointer device stopped working on macOS Monterey guests (#5237)\r\n* (macOS) AVM: Added option to use emulated trackpad (requires macOS Ventura guest)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc).

Vector instruction support can improve the performance of certain workloads.\r\n* (macOS) **Guest interface commands**. New commands accessible from the scripting interface as well as the command line interface (utmctl) can be used to read/write files, execute commands, and list IP addresses. These commands require QEMU guest agent to be installed.\r\n* (macOS) **Scripting interface additions**. The scripting interface now allows for creation of a new VM, configuration an existing VM, changing drive image, and more. See [this page](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/reference/) for more details and [the cheat sheet](https://docs.getutm.app/scripting/cheat-sheet/) for example usage.\r\n* (macOS) **External read-write drive images**. In QEMU, if a supported drive interface is selected (USB, Floppy, etc) along with an image type of Disk, the drive can now be marked as either read-only or read-write. This can be used as an alternative way of transferring data to and from the VM when the guest does not support SPICE or VirtFS. In AVF, support for read-write images has be fixed as well (when \"read only\" is unchecked in the settings).\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.4)\r\n* UTM will now display the release notes the first time a new version is launched\r\n* Updated ANGLE which should fix some GPU acceleration issues on Linux (please see known issues below for unresolved issues)\r\n* Fixed an issue where a removable drive or VirtIO shared directory was set up when QEMUHelper was already running and therefore was not able to create a bookmark and an \"access denied\" error shows up on startup\r\n* Introduced a new preference setting for using the Option key as Meta in the built in console. This was on by default in previous versions and is not off by default which should allow international text to be entered properly (#5202)\r\n* Wizard: Make virtio-gpu-pci default for Linux (again) which was reverted a few releases ago in order to address some GPU issues\r\n* Translation: updated Polish (thanks @matgaj)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed built in terminal overlapping in the safe area\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.2.3)\r\n* Added support for read-write removable devices on supported interfaces (USB, Floppy, etc).

This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer. When mounted to a second CD drive, the installer will install the correct drivers, bypass secure boot/TPM requirements, and launch the SPICE tools installer on first login.\r\n* (macOS) **Resize QEMU disk images.** In the drives settings page, you can now expand the size of the QCOW2 disk image.\r\n* (iOS) **QEMU Virtualization for M1 iPad.** With the release of [TrollStore](https://github.com/opa334/TrollStore), you can now enable Hypervisor on iOS. Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spainish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* The configuration backend has been massively rewritten. **Please backup all VMs prior to updating as you will not be able to re-open VMs saved by UTM v4 on older versions of UTM if you decide to downgrade.**\r\n* Since v4.0.6, the order of generated devices has changed to always create network devices first. This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10) or [this guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04) for Ubuntu install issues.\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x.

To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* On i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n* In v4.3.5, we rolled back backend updates to QEMU and EDK2 due to a critical issue that prevented VMs from booting. While the issue is investigated, the last stable version will be used and once the issue is resolved, a new update will be released.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.5)\r\n* Rollback QEMU version to 7.2.0\r\n* Rollback EDK2 firmware to edk2-stable202102\r\n* Reduced amount of logging when Debug Log is not checked\r\n* (macOS) Wizard: Fixed boot ISO not saving for AVF (#5517)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE.

This means that v4.3.1 may contain a lot of UI bugs as testing is needed to make sure the new internals match up with the existing UI. Please help us by reporting any such issue you stumble upon.\r\n* **TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot** This is required for Windows 11 updates to 22H2. To enable TPM on an existing virtual machine (only x86_64, i386, and ARM64 architectures are supported), open the VM settings, go to the QEMU page and select \"UEFI Boot\", \"TPM 2.0 Device\", and \"Reset UEFI Variables.\" Any new VM created through the wizard will have TPM 2.0 and Secure Boot enabled by default if Windows 10+ support is checked.\r\n* **Download Windows installer with a new utility.** We know that creating a Windows installer can be a hassle which is why we are releasing a new free tool called CrystalFetch which can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/TuringSoftware/CrystalFetch) as well as free on the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/crystalfetch-iso-downloader/id6454431289). This companion to UTM will allow you to generate a Windows 11 ISO with a few clicks (no Terminal, Homebrew, or scripts required). Note that just like before, you still need a valid license from Microsoft to use Windows.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nOn i386 and x86_64 machines, HPET is now disabled by default. This improves performance (slightly) on some guests and also addresses boot issues with OpenIndiana. This change means that suspended VM state from previous versions are not compatible, so please shut down those VMs before updating. If you require HPET to be enabled for any reason, go into the VM's settings and under QEMU \u2192 QEMU Machine Properties, add the text `hpet=on`.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.4)\r\n* Localization: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Fixed WebDAV shared directory not setup on start (#5506)\r\n* (macOS) Improved debug logging by showing more verbose logging for SPICE. If \"Enable Debug Log\" is selected, more verbose logging will be activated.\r\n* (macOS) Fixed an issue where the VM freezes or shows \"port not connected\" when the computer is under memory pressure (#5489)\r\n* (macOS 11) Disabled options in the context menu which had broken UI leading to freezes or crashes (#5147)\r\n* (macOS 12) Wizard: Fixed a crash when selecting a file with VoiceOver (#5250)\r\n* (macOS 12+) Settings: new table view for QEMU custom arguments\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.3)\r\n* Fixed a crash when selecting a VM (#5481)\r\n* Fixed a crash when starting a VM and an error occurred when creating display/serial devices (#5472)\r\n* Fixed boot issues when trying to load OpenIndiana by disabling HPET timers by default (#2394)\r\n* Fixed an issue where selected removable drive image and shared directory are not syncing correctly\r\n* QEMUKit: Fixed race condition when multiple RPC commands are sent (#5477)\r\n* EDK2: Fixed an issue preventing some versions of Windows 11 from booting (#5495)\r\n* utmctl: Add a more verbose error message when utmctl fails because it is launched from an SSH session or before logging in (#5499)\r\n* Wizard: Fixed selected boot ISO not saving (#5471)\r\n* Wizard: Link to CrystalFetch when Windows is selected\r\n* (macOS) AVF: Automatically un-capture system keys when VM terminates\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.3.2)\r\n* The last update introduced two units per bus for IDE devices.

One workaround is to switch to Xorg from the log-in screen (typically by clicking on the gear icon) and another is to patch Mesa to a newer version.\r\n* Debian 12 fails to load the GUI installer when GPU acceleration is enabled. Please use the text installer instead.\r\n* The Metal renderer backend is broken on macOS, please change your renderer to OpenGL or \"Default\"\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n* [iOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/ios/)\r\n* [macOS](https://docs.getutm.app/installation/macos/)\r\n\r\n| File | Description | Installation | JIT | Hypervisor | USB |\r\n|------|------------|--------------|-----|-----------|-----|\r\n| UTM.deb | Jailbroken iOS version | Open in Cydia, dpkg, or Sileo | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.dmg | macOS version | Mounting and copying UTM.app to /Applications | Yes | Yes | Yes |\r\n| UTM.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, etc (see guide) | Yes(2) | No | No |\r\n| UTM.HV.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (TrollStore) | TrollStore | Yes | Yes(1) | Yes |\r\n| UTM.SE.ipa | Non-jailbroken iOS version (sideloading) | AltStore, enterprise signing, etc | No | No | No |\r\n\r\n1.

This is due to a number of guest-side driver issues in the latest version of Mesa (#4983). As a result of these issues, we decided to disable GPU acceleration in Linux by default for new VMs created by the wizard. If you have an existing VM with graphical issues, you can disable GPU acceleration by going into the VM settings, under Display, change the Emulated Display Card to `virtio-gpu-pci` or another card that does not have `-gl` in the name. You can verify that GPU acceleration is disabled when the checkbox below the card is unchecked.\r\n\r\n## Highlights\r\n* **QEMU backend updated to v7.2.0**. Also updated usbredir (0.13.0), virglrenderer (latest commit), ANGLE (latest commit)\r\n* **Improved renderer backend**. Lots of bug fixes and stability improvements to GPU accelerated Linux VMs (most common crashes when GPU acceleration is enabled should be gone now). New option to change the renderer backend to ANGLE Metal and limit FPS (in Preferences). Switching to Metal is highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build (UTM.HV.ipa) now supports JIT**. Additionally, there is now in-app settings.\r\n* (iOS) **TrollStore build now supports TSO (Total Store Ordering)**. TSO is used by Rosetta on the Mac to improve x86_64 emulation on ARM64. It can now be used on M1 iPads with QEMU to improve performance of FEX-Emu or a patched Rosetta. Note that it is recommended that TSO be disabled if you do not need to emulate x86_64 because it can reduce performance of other tasks.\r\n* (macOS) **AppleScript (OSA) support and CLI interface**. You can control parts of UTM through the OSA interface. Currently there is support for listing VMs as well as start/stop/suspend operations and the ability to print out the guest serial port connections. More functionality will be added in the future. A command line application is also provided in `UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl` (which you can symlink to `/usr/local/bin/utmctl` if desired) that can be used for automation tasks without needing to learn AppleScript.\r\n* (macOS 13+) **Menu bar extra**. You can enable the menu bar extra icon in Preferences (Cmd+,) as well as disable the dock icon. The menu bar extra provides a minimal interface to start/stop/suspend VMs and is useful when paired with headless VMs (a VM that does not have any display or terminal console installed).\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the minimum supported systems for UTM v4.x. Please use UTM v3.x for support down to iOS 11 and macOS 11\r\n* ~~Newly created Linux VMs will now use `virtio-gpu-gl-pci` by default. It is recommended that you change the display card of existing QEMU backend Linux VMs to this card in order to take advantage of the improved renderer backend. This should result in improved performance in GUI rendering. Note that some applications (particularly 3D applications) may lock up or crash UTM and if you are experiencing issues, you can go back to `virtio-ramfb` or `virtio-vga`.~~\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. There is NO 3D acceleration drivers for Windows yet, so unlike Linux, this will not improve any compatibility with applications. However, the GL backend can still be beneficial to Windows users because it has smoother animations and less tearing and artifacts. The overall benefits will not be as pronounced as for Linux VMs so it is optional that you change existing VMs to a `-gl` display card.\r\n* (iOS) It is recommended that you switch to the Metal backend in Preferences for better performance. However, some applications such as `glxgears` will not work with the Metal backend.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.6)\r\n* Wizard: Re-introduced the checkbox for \"Hardware OpenGL Acceleration\" which is disabled by default due to guest-side issues in the latest Mesa driver\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.5)\r\n* Improved rendering of non-GL graphics on the new renderer backend. This should reduce some of the tearing seen in earlier updates. For the best performance, it is recommended that a GL backend is selected.\r\n* Support read-only disk images in QEMU backend as well as selecting images that are read-only (#4838) Note: all external drive images (ISOs) are now loaded as read-only, this was not enforced in previous versions due to an error in the logic.\r\n* Newly created Windows VMs will now use `virtio-ramfb-gl` (Apple Silicon) or `virtio-vga-gl` (Intel) by default. See the Notes section for more information.\r\n* Fixed an issue where the incorrect tmp directory path was used by QEMU (#4882)\r\n* Scripting: Fixed an issue where the proper error message was not displayed in some cases.\r\n* CLI: Improved some help text.\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.4)\r\n* Fixed slow rendering of GRUB and EFI menus\r\n* Introduced new optimizations to renderer: bliting done on GPU instead of CPU now (for non-GL rendering), guest draw calls that are faster than the monitor refresh rate are now consolidated before drawing at vblank, rendering of multiple displays can happen concurrently now\r\n* Fixed rendering to multiple displays on the new renderer backend\r\n* Fixed an issue in QEMU where the vmnet backend uses 100% of CPU when the VM is suspended (#4803)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: Fixed JIT enable in the HV builds\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore: New option to enable TSO (Total Store Ordering) in QEMU settings (see Highlights for more details)\r\n* (iOS) Restored the default renderer backend to GL. This was changed in v4.1.3 because Metal is faster but the new backend can introduce regressions such as `glxgears` not working (#4856). As a result, the new backend is now opt-in but is still highly recommended.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when changing VM settings on iOS 14 (#4864)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed crash when starting a VM with UTM SE (#4848)\r\n* (macOS) A tooltip will now reveal why suspend functionality is disabled\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.3)\r\n* Updated QEMU to v7.2.0\r\n* Reworked CocoaSpice renderer to respond faster to GL updates from the guest, should improve frame pacing on GL supported Linux VMs\r\n* Added global setting to change renderer backend, introduce ANGLE Metal as an option (and also the new default for iOS)\r\n* Added global setting to limit FPS which can be used to improve frame pacing for a smoother rendering experience\r\n* Settings: clearly show if the current display hardware supports GPU acceleration\r\n* Wizard: GPU acceleration is now enabled by default when Linux is selected as the operating system\r\n* Fixed crash due to an error with `GL_DRAW_COOKIE_INVALID` (#4722)\r\n* Fixed deadlock on startup caused by gstosxaudio (#2364)\r\n* Fixed memory leak when GPU acceleration is enabled (#4449)\r\n* Fixed crash in `-[MTLResourceList releaseAllObjectsAndReset]` (#3519)\r\n* Fixed Mesa issue causing some GNOME desktop to freeze when GPU acceleration is enabled\r\n* Fixed incorrect logic when cloning a VM (#4815)\r\n* Fixed some thread scheduling warning (#4352)\r\n* Localization: updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* (iOS) TrollStore build: use `com.apple.private.security.no-sandbox` instead of `com.apple.private.security.no-container` on recommendation of other devs and to align with how other apps perform JIT.\r\n* (iOS) Fixed blank screen when choosing \"Open\" in the wizard (#4842)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed toolbar not auto-hiding before first interaction (#4844)\r\n* (macOS) New design for global settings (Cmd+,) which better organizes the settings\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed crash when `utmctl help attach` runs (#4817)\r\n* (macOS) utmctl: Fixed `utmctl stop` with `--request` and `kill` (#4850)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.2)\r\n* Localization: updated Spanish (Latin America) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* Localization: updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0 and @skyarrow87)\r\n* Localization: updated Chinese Simplified (thanks @changanmoon)\r\n* (iOS) Fix new VM wizard not appearing on < iOS 14.5 (#4776)\r\n* (macOS) Implement OSA interface for AppleScript\r\n* (macOS) Introduce a CLI application (`UTM.app/Contents/MacOS/utmctl`) that wraps around the OSA interface for automation\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to enable a menu bar extra icon for controlling VMs\r\n* (macOS 13+) New settings option to disable the dock icon\r\n* (macOS) Fix various alignment issues in settings (#4596) (thanks @JezerM)\r\n* (macOS) Fix a crash when the pasteboard is updated (#4745)\r\n* (macOS) Support custom resolutions for Apple Virtualization VMs\r\n* (macOS) Fixed a UI freeze when canceling out of the settings for an Apple Virtualization VM\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.1.1)\r\n* Fixed launching SPARC machines (#4575)\r\n* Fixed an error when attempting to save a VM where one of its removable drives is linked to a file that has been deleted\r\n* Fixed IPSW/.utm download failing when the device goes to sleep (the download should resume after wake up)\r\n* Restored scroll bars when system is set to always show scroll bars.

On macOS, a new window will be created for each display and builtin terminal. On iOS, you can create multiple windows (iPad) as well as plug in an external display or AirPlay (iPad or iPhone) and assign outputs to each window.\r\n* **Ventura updates to Virtualization.** macOS Ventura introduces new features that is now integrated into UTM. You can now create GUI Linux VMs with EFI boot. Directory sharing now works with macOS Ventura guests. Rosetta x86_64 emulation is supported for Linux VMs on Apple Silicon. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian/ for an installation guide. Note that base M1 chip users may experience issues that will be addressed in a future update.\r\n* **VirtFS sharing for QEMU.** This alternative directory sharing backend is supported by Linux and can have better performance. Note that macOS UID are numbered differently than Linux so you may have to run `chown` in the guest. Check out https://docs.getutm.app/guest-support/linux/ for more details.\r\n* **Easier Windows 10/11 installation and Windows guest tools downloader.** You can now download and mount the Windows drivers and guest tools ISO image with a single click (macOS: disk icon in VM window, iOS: 3D touch context menu on home screen). Additionally, the ISO now include an \"Autounattend.xml\" which is recognized by the Windows 10/11 installer.

Note that only M1 hardware and kernel have support for Hypervisor. iOS 14.4.2-14.5.1 is supported only on M1 iPad Pro jailbroken with fugu14/unc0ver. iOS 14.0-15.5b4 is supported on any M1 iPad running TrollStore.\r\n* **New documentation site.** https://docs.getutm.app/ is the home of the official UTM documentation.\r\n* **New localization.** Thanks to various community members, UTM is now translated to: Chinese (Simplified), Chinese (Traditional), Finnish, French, German, Japanese, Korean, and Spanish (Latin America)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* **iOS 14 and macOS 11.3** are the new minimum supported systems.

This is to address an issue on some distributions (such as Ubuntu) where adding a device (drive, display, etc) would require re-configurating the network because the device name changed. Unfortunately, this change will cause the configuration issue to occur once more on any existing VM that is susceptible to the network issue. On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.9)\r\n\r\n* Fixed some broken links to documentation (#4529)\r\n* Fixed an issue where running ARM64 emulation on ARM64 gives an error \"The \u2018host\u2019 CPU type can only be used with KVM or HVF\" (#4528)\r\n* Fixed a regression where S390x and SPARC VMs cannot start due to missing USB bus\r\n* (iOS) Fixed UTM SE cannot launch any VMs (#4516)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

On Ubuntu, this will require you to modify `/etc/netplan/00-installer-config.yaml` and change the adapter name from `enp0s9` (or whatever it is currently) to `enp0s1` (which reflects the new device ordering). Other Linux distributions may require a similar change. However, after updating the guest network configuration, you should no longer have issues with networking when making device changes to the VM.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.8)\r\n\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator and @alexis-martel)\r\n* Translation: Added German (thanks @conath)\r\n* (macOS) Disable resize button in GUI Apple VM window\r\n* (macOS) Reverted some SwiftUI issue workarounds that are no longer present in Ventura RC\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.7)\r\n\r\n* Fixed renamed VM not appearing on next launch (#4469)\r\n* Fixed TCP server not working (#4479)\r\n* Fixed random network issues caused by invalid MAC address generation (you must re-generate MAC to apply the change if your VM created in UTM v4 does not have working network) (#4477)\r\n* Fixed a crash when trying to boot Kali Linux with terminal enabled\r\n* Fixed hypervisor on iOS 14.6-14.8\r\n* Added new setting for serial device in TCP server mode to listen on remote/local interfaces (#4483)\r\n* Fixed URL automation sending text to terminal\r\n* Translation: Updated Japanese (thanks @MMP0)\r\n* Translation: Updated French (thanks @FRtranslator)\r\n* Wizard: Link to new documentation site (#4443, #4445)\r\n* (iOS) Fixed disponible run option not appearing\r\n* (macOS) Fixed settings getting stuck at information page (#4465)\r\n* (macOS) Updated display menu option to match title bar when multiple displays are used (#4484)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no mouse/keyboard on Intel Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed no audio input device on Linux running on Apple Virtualization (#4409)\r\n* (macOS) Fixed auto-quit when all windows are closed happening when headless VM is still running\r\n\r\n## Changes (v4.0.6)\r\n\r\n* Fixed an issue in argument generation where PS/2 input was forced even when USB was enabled (#4424)\r\n* Validate settings on save before closing the settings dialog\r\n* Network devices are now created first before all other devices.

Check out https://www.qemu.org/2022/04/19/qemu-7-0-0/ for more details. Additionally, other backend components such as SPICE GTK, libusbredir, and more have also been updated.\r\n* **Reclaiming space**: the host will attempt to TRIM any page of all zeros when committed to the QCOW2 disk image. Additionally, a new button in disk settings will allow you to re-convert a disk image to reclaim space (of all-zero pages) as well as compress an existing disk image (macOS 12+ only). Note compression is only done statically which means when the guest modifies a sector, it will be stored uncompressed just like before.\r\n* **Disposable mode**: right click/long press on a QEMU VM and select \"Run without saving changes\" to start VM in \"disposable mode.\" In this mode, changes will not be saved to disk and will be discarded once the VM is stopped. (thanks @ktprograms)\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* Reminder: for troubleshooting common Windows install issues (such as no networking), please check out the [guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/windows-10) or [this guide](https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/ubuntu-20-04) for Ubuntu install issues.\r\n* If you manually added `highmem=on` or `highmem=off` to your QEMU Machine Properties as a workaround to issues in a previous release, please remove it.\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.2.x will be the last update to support iOS 11-13.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.2.x.
